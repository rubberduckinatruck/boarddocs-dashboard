          "PURPOSE": "For the 2025-2026 fiscal year, the District’s agreement with Educational Services, Inc. (ESI), provides continuation of employment for employees who are eligible for retirement under the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS), but who have been offered contracts for the 2025-2026 school year. The agreement also provides the ability to obtain the services of additional personnel should vacancies occur throughout the year or to rehire retirees throughout the year as their retirement dates are actualized. There are two changes from the 2025-2026 fiscal year agreement. First change; replacing Paragraph 13, which expands the language on ESI’s Liability Insurance. Second change; replaced Exhibit A to reflect the updated fees previously shared.",

The District realizes a savings while being fortunate to retain experienced and qualified employees who are eligible for retirement. Employees benefit by being retained in the position and continuing to serve the District at a reduced salary while receiving their retirement benefits. Our District has benefited for many years by being able to retain valued and experienced employees through a phased retirement program.",

There were two thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight (2928) notified users (vendors) and two (2) responses received.

The estimated requirements cover the period of the contracts and are reasonable and continuing. The use of the subsequent multi-term contracts will serve the best interests of the school district by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economies of scale in school district procurement. If monies are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract can be canceled.",

An ESA is an account administered by the Arizona Department of Education and funded by state tax dollars to provide options for the education of qualified students in the state of Arizona. By accepting an ESA, a student may not enroll in a public district school, charter school, and/or public online school (including summer public school), without paying the school, or accept any School Tuition Organization (STO) scholarship or tax credit scholarship. Administration seeks Governing Board approval of the ESA Tuition rate for Fiscal Year 2025-2026 for an ESA student. ESA Tuition shall be charged at $1,270.00 per class for each semester. An additional $1,000.00 shall be charged for each club or extra curricular activity. This would create a separate tuition rate for the purposes of ESA students."

The proposed courses support the district's strategic commitment to diverse learning pathways, curriculum innovation, and responsiveness to evolving student needs and aspirations. Due to the number of new courses associated with The Hilltop School for the Arts, a new individual course proposal form is not being submitted for each course.

          "ADDITIONAL_NOTES": "STUDENT, EMPLOYEE, AND /OR COMMUNITY BENEFIT: These new courses will expand access to high-quality instruction and learning experiences in fine and performing arts and support students to develop specialized industry skills, critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration skills. They will also provide foundational training for students pursuing postsecondary studies or careers in the arts. The community benefits through enhanced arts programming and potential public exhibitions and performances. The Hilltop does not assess individual course fees. Instead, students are required to pay an annual Arts Academy Fee of $200. This comprehensive fee supports program-wide resources, materials, and experiences that enhance student learning and artistic development. Due to the breadth of fine arts offerings at The Hilltop, this consolidated annual fee represents a more cost-effective approach for families compared to applying individual course fees equivalent to those at a comprehensive campus."
